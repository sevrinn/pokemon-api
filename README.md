# Poke API & Poke API with Axios

Created a React project that uses the useEffect hook to display the names of all the pokemon with the Pokemon API.

I then downloaded Axios, included it and I changed useEffect to use axios to fetch the data from the url. Axios makes it so you dont have to convert the results into json.

I was able to print out as many or as little pokemon names as I wanted from the endpoint by configuring the offset and limit in the url
